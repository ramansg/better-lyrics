# Contributing to Better Lyrics

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide covers both code and translation contributions.

## Issue-First Policy

**Open an issue before submitting a PR.** Discuss proposed changes first to ensure alignment with project direction. PRs without prior discussion may be closed.

Exception: Typo fixes and small documentation updates can be submitted directly.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/better-lyrics/better-lyrics.git
cd better-lyrics
npm install
npm run build
```

For loading the extension in your browser, see [Manual Installation](README.md#manual-installation) in the README.

### Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev       # Watch mode with hot reload
npm run build     # Production build
npm run lint      # Run linter & formatter
npm run typecheck # TypeScript type check
```

## Code Guidelines

### Imports

- Use path aliases: `@core/*`, `@constants`, `@utils`, `@modules/*`
- Named imports only: `import { foo } from "module"` (no `import * as`)
- Never import from `@/index` (causes content script execution in wrong context)

### DOM & Security

- Never use `innerHTML` - use `createElement`, `textContent`, `replaceChildren`
- No empty catch blocks - always log errors with context

### Error Logging

- Content scripts: Use `log()` from `@utils` with constants from `@constants`
- Options/extension pages: Use `console.error()` with log prefix constants

### Style

- No inline comments unless essential
- Section dividers format: `// -- Section Name --------------------------`

## Pull Request Process

1. Open an issue first (unless trivial fix)
2. Fork and create a feature branch
3. Follow code guidelines above
4. Ensure typecheck, lint & builds pass ( `npm run typecheck` `npm run lint` `npm run build`)

### Review Expectations

- PRs are reviewed for code quality, security, and alignment with project patterns
- Be prepared for feedback and iteration
- Large changes may require multiple rounds of review

## Translation Guide

Better Lyrics uses [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/better-lyrics) for translation management.

### How to Contribute Translations

1. Visit the [Better Lyrics Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/better-lyrics)
2. Select your language (or request a new one)
3. Translate strings directly in the Crowdin interface
4. Translations are automatically synced to the repository

### Translation Tips

- Keep translations concise - UI space is limited
- Preserve placeholders like `$1`, `$2` in strings
- Check context in the `description` field for each string

### Key Naming Convention

Keys follow `<area>_<component>_<element>` pattern:
- `options_tab_general` - Options page, tab, general
- `marketplace_install` - Marketplace, install button
- `lyrics_source` - Lyrics display, source label
